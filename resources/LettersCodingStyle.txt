                  The Official Letters Coding Style Guide
                  =======================================
                              By Gus Mueller
                       (now you know who to blame)


First, read Apple's Coding Guidelines for Cocoa:

And you should be familiar with the modern runtime for 64 bit apps in 10.6:

Class names in the Letters project are prefixed with LA
Class names in the LetterBox project are prefixed with LB

Spacing: 4 spaces for indentation, no tabs.

Brackets go in the following style:

if (foo) {
    bar();
}

Always use brackets, even if you only have a single statment after a
conditional.  ie, this is the wrong way:

if (foo) bar();


When assigning a var in a conditional statment, use two parens:

while ((foo = [e nextObject])) {
	<#statements#>
}


An example class:
-----------------

LBObject.h:

@interface LBObject : NSObject {
    @private
    NSString *someNonPropertyIvar;
    IBOutlet NSTextField *somePrivateField;
}

// properties go above the public methods:
@property (nonatomic, assign) IBOutlet NSTableView *tableView;
@property (retain) NSString *foo;
@property (retain) NSDictionary *bar;

- (void)myGreatAction:(id)sender;

@end


LBObject.m:

#import "LBObject.h"

// Class extensions go at the top
@interface LBObject ()
- (void)registerForNotifications;
@end


@implementation LBObject

// synthesized properties go at the top
@synthesize foo;
@synthesize bar;
@synthesize tableView;

// if you have one, your initialize goes at the very very top.
+ (void)initialize {
    // 
}

// inits go next, in the following style.
- (id)init {
	self = [super init];
	if (self != nil) {
		// stuff here.
	}
	return self;
}

// deallocs go right below the init.
- (void)dealloc {
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self];
    
    [foo release];
    [bar release];
    
    // You can also assign your ivars to nil here, if you think they might be
    // referrenced after this point for some reason.
    // However, it'd be great if they didn't (because that would be a bug) and
    // we should probably fix the case where that happens.
    
    // foo = nil;
    // bar = nil;
    
    [super dealloc];
}


// and all your wonderful methods go below.
- (void)myGreatAction:(id)sender {
    
}

- (void)registerForNotifications {
    
}

@end
